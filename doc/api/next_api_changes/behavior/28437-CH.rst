*alpha* parameter handling in _ImageBase._make_image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This PR expands and clarifies code logic in _ImageBase._make_image
related to the *alpha* parameter, and ensures that `~.Axes.imshow`
exhibits the following behavior:

1. When the image does not have alpha channel:
- *alpha* not specified: default to 1.0.
- scalar *alpha*: broadcast.
- array *alpha*: concatenate.
2. When the image has an alpha channel:
- *alpha* not specified: nothings needs to be done.
- scalar *alpha*: multiply the alpha channel with user-specified scalar.
- array *alpha*: replace the alpha channel with user-specified array.
